One day, the labeling machine malfunctions and incorrectly labels the containers of fruit.
Your coworker decides to play a game. 
He pulls up three crates and tells you that one of them has apples, one has oranges,and the last one has both apples and oranges in it. 
You can see that one is labeled "A" for apples, another "O" for oranges, and the third "A+O" for both apples and oranges. 
Your coworker reminds you that all three crates are incorrectly labeled.
